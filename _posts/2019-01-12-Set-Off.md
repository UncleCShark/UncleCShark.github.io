Yippee!!! I set off down the bumpy road on a trip to Cmakeland. Finally after a few days I got a hang of GitHub Pages. This service is based on fantastic [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). This simple tool can create fantastic static html pages for you. You write in a simple Markdown and Jekyll transforms it to beautifull HTML for you. What a fantastic piggybacking. Unfortunatelly Github Pages add many other knobs to use. I needed some time to learn. Sorry I went off a little on a tangent. I prepare for you a tutorial which shows a new way of using an old tools in a new fashion. Short and sweet [Moder Cmake](https://cmake.org/)+[Ninja](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ninja_(build_system)) as a modern duo for cross-platform programming. If you are interested in cross-platform programming please visit a [UncleCShark's](https://github.com/UncleCShark) project about [Cmaketopia](https://unclecshark.github.io/Cmaketopia/).
