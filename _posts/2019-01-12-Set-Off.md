Yippee!!! I set off down the bumpy road on a trip to [Cmakeland](https://unclecshark.github.io/Cmaketopia/). Finally after a few days I got a hang of [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). This service is based on fantastic [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). This simple tool can create fantastic static html pages for you. You write a document  in  simple lightweight [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) and [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) transforms it to beautifull HTML for you. What a fantastic piggybacking. Unfortunatelly [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) add many other knobs to use. I needed some time to learn. Sorry I went off a little on a tangent. I prepare for you a tutorial (a constantly evolving document without a strict "release" date ) which shows a new way of using old tools in a new fashion. Short and sweet this is a pair work [Cmake](https://cmake.org/)+[Ninja](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ninja_(build_system)) as a modern duo/tools for cross-platform programming. If you are interested in cross-platform programming please visit a [UncleCShark's](https://github.com/UncleCShark) project about [Cmaketopia](https://unclecshark.github.io/Cmaketopia/).
