Last days it was time I had to put my ideas about [Cmakeland](https://unclecshark.github.io/Cmaketopia/) on the back burner. Together with my new friend [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) we added some features and made some fixes to [Cmaketopia](https://unclecshark.github.io/Cmaketopia/) page:

{:.posts}

* dynamic menu based on css and javascript
* rearranging of pages
* some small fixes
* and a [badge](https://unclecshark.github.io/Cmaketopia/Docs/Badge) Yeah we have one !!!!!

It's free to print or download, but remember when you use it some magic will happen. You are becomming the Cmaketopian at heart. Be carefull and don't touch it if you don't agree with [the Cmaketopia philosophy](https://unclecshark.github.io/Cmaketopia/Docs/Introduction).
