"Die Slowly" by Pablo Neruda 

He who does not travel,<br/>
who does not read,<br/>
who does not listen to music,<br/>
who does not find grace in himself, dies slowly.<br/>

He who slowly destroys his own self-esteem,<br/>
who does not allow himself to be helped,<br/> 
who spends days on end complaining about his own bad luck,<br/>
about the rain that never stops, dies slowly.<br/>

He who becomes the slave of habit,<br/> 
who follows the same routes every day,<br/> 
who never changes pace,<br/>
who does not risk and change the colour of his clothes,<br/>
who does not speak and does not experience, dies slowly.<br/>

He or she who shuns passion,<br/>
who prefers black on white,<br/>
dotting ones rather than a bundle of emotions,<br/>
the kind that make your eyes glimmer,<br/>
that turn a yawn into a smile,<br/>
that make the heart pound in the face of mistakes and feelings, dies slowly.<br/>

He or she who does not turn things topsy-turvy,<br/>
who is unhappy at work,<br/>
who does not risk certainty for uncertainty,<br/>
to thus follow a dream,<br/>
those who do not forego sound advice at least once in their lives, die slowly.<br/>

He or she who abandon a project before starting it,<br/>
who fail to ask questions on subjects he doesn’t know,<br/>
he or she who don’t reply when they are asked something they do know, die slowly.<br/>

Let’s try and avoid death in small doses,<br/>
always reminding oneself that being alive requires an effort by far<br/>
greater than the simple fact of breathing.<br/>

Only a burning patience will lead to the attainment of a splendid happiness.<br/>
