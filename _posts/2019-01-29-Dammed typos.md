Although I'm Polish I love English language but not completely. English grammar is simple just OK.
I can get my head around it. What about spelling, English spelling is a total mess. In Polish quite contrary the grammar is a mess, spelling is easy it's phonetic. A perfect language where are you? I try blogging in English but it's not easy for me. I made too many spelling errors. There is a solution. Remember you may use a spellchecker when you write a markdown file. The spellchecker extension can correct your spelling errors. I use [Spell Right](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ban.spellright) by Bartosz Antosik. This is an excellent extension of VS Code. To see more details follow a link above. Happy markdowning.:smile:
