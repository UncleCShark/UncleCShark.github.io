Finally, I finished my first part of [Cmaketopia](https://unclecshark.github.io/Cmaketopia/). [Highway to hell for a tough cookie](https://unclecshark.github.io/Cmaketopia/Docs/CommandLine) - this part is for beginners who wanted to be familiar with a compiler toolchain. After reading it you'll be able to compile SQLite from source code as you like. If you are in cross-platform programming, please read it and leave me a chit.
