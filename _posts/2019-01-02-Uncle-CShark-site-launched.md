Well. Finally got around to putting all things together in an apple-pie order. It actually is a lot easier than I thought it was going to be. With [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) that was as easy as falling off a log. If you want to know how I did it just follow this simple tutorial [Creating_and_Hosting_a_Personal Site_on_GitHub](http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/) by Jonathan McGlone.
